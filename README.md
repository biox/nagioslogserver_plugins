# Nagios Log Server Plugins
This repository is used to host my Nagios Log Server plugins - they can be used to monitor various metrics in the system that are not monitored by default. 

These plugins do not yet follow the appropriate Plugin Developer Guidelines - I am working toward that point. I wanted to provide my work early so that you could use my code before development is complete.

All work is my own.
